### Elevator Pitch

In a complex, interdependent eco-system, where each system’s components are evolving rapidly,
we want to make the dependencies between these components explicit in the form of contracts.
By doing so, Contract Testing helps us get instantaneous feedback when we make changes to avoid accidental breakage.
With this ability, we can now deploy, at will, any system’s component at any time without having to completely depend on expensive Integration Tests.

Systems interact with each other through several means. Qontract hopes to address all these mechanisms and not just web interactions.
* API calls (JSon Rest, SOAP XML, gRPC, Thrift, other binary protocols)
* Events via Messaging (Kafka, )
* DB
* File system
* Libraries, SDK 
* OS Level Pipes
